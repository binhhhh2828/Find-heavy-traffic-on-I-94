# Heavy Traffic Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes real-world traffic volume data to identify congestion patterns, peak hours, and the impact of weather conditions on road usage.  
The goal is to provide **actionable insights** for urban traffic planning and congestion mitigation strategies.

##  Dataset
- Source: [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume - Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pooriamst/metro-interstate-traffic-volume/data)
- Contains information on traffic volume, date/time, weather conditions, and temperature.  

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Analysis Process
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, data types, etc.)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends
3. Data visualization for clear insight presentation
4. Correlation analysis between traffic volume and external factors

##  Key Insights
- **Highest congestion** occurs between **14:00–17:00**, especially on **Wednesday to Friday**.
- **Weekday rush hours**: **06:00–08:00** and **16:00–17:00**.
- **Weekends** average **~4,000 vehicles/hour from 12:00–17:00**.
- **No significant correlation** between temperature and traffic volume.
- **Lowest congestion** observed during **thunderstorms** and **drizzle**.
